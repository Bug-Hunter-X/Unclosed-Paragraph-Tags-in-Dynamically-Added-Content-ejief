# Unclosed Paragraph Tags in Dynamically Added Content

This example demonstrates a subtle HTML error that can occur when dynamically adding content to the DOM. The issue stems from adding multiple paragraph elements within a div without properly wrapping them within a container that is semantically correct, causing unexpected rendering issues or rendering errors in some browsers. 

## Bug Description

The bug is present in `bug.html`.  The JavaScript code dynamically adds content to a div, but fails to enclose the newly added paragraphs within a valid container element leading to issues with the structure of the HTML. 

## Solution Description

The solution (`solution.html`) addresses this by wrapping the newly added paragraphs within a container element, fixing the structural error.  The content is wrapped in a <div> tag, this can be altered as the project needs may require.
